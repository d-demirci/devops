This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\\` and `\/` characters as path separators, however `\\` is a valid filename character on posix systems. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit.

This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `\/home\/user\/.bashrc` would turn into `home\/user\/.bashrc`.

This is checked properly in the patched versions.\n\nFinally, a defense in depth check is added, such that if the `entry.absolute` is outside of the extraction taret, and we are not in preservePaths:true mode, a warning is raised on that entry, and it is skipped.  Currently, it is believed that this check is redundant, but it did catch some oversights in development.\n","notes": "","references": [ {"source": "Advisory 1070363: Arbitrary File Creation\/Overwrite on Windows via insufficient relative path sanitization","name": "- https:\/\/github.com\/npm\/node-tar\/security\/advisories\/GHSA-5955-9wpr-37jh\n- https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/tar\n- https:\/\/nvd.nist.gov\/vuln\/detail\/CVE-2021-37713\n- https:\/\/www.oracle.com\/security-alerts\/cpuoct2021.html\n- https:\/\/cert-portal.siemens.com\/productcert\/pdf\/ssa-389290.pdf\n- https:\/\/github.com\/advisories\/GHSA-5955-9wpr-37jh"}],"vulnerableSoftware": [ {"software": { "id":"cpe:2.3:a:*:tar:\\<4.4.18:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}}]}, {"source": "NPM","name": "1070366","unscored": "true", "severity" : "high","cwes": [],"description": "### Impact\nArbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution\n\nnode-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted.

When a symbolic link is encountered on Windows systems, the entire directory cache is cleared.

All paths are normalized to use `\/` as a path separator, replacing `\\` with `\/` on Windows systems, and leaving `\\` intact in the path on posix systems.  This is performed in depth, at every level of the program where paths are consumed.\n2. Directory cache pruning is performed case-insensitively.  This _may_ result in undue cache misses on case-sensitive file systems, but the performance impact is negligible.\n\n#### Caveat\n\nNote that this means that the `entry` objects exposed in various parts of tar's API will now always use `\/` as a path separator, even on Windows systems.  This is not expected to cause problems, as `\/` is a valid path separator on Windows systems, but _may_ result in issues if `entry.path` is compared against a path string coming from some other API such as `fs.realpath()` or `path.resolve()`.\n\nUsers are encouraged to always normalize paths using a well-tested method such as `path.resolve()` before comparing paths to one another.","notes": "","references": [ {"source": "Advisory 1070369: Arbitrary File Creation\/Overwrite via insufficient symlink protection due to directory cache poisoning using symbolic links","name": "- https:\/\/github.com\/npm\/node-tar\/security\/advisories\/GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc\n- https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/tar\n- https:\/\/nvd.nist.gov\/vuln\/detail\/CVE-2021-37701\n- https:\/\/www.oracle.com\/security-alerts\/cpuoct2021.html\n- https:\/\/www.debian.org\/security\/2021\/dsa-5008\n- https:\/\/cert-portal.siemens.com\/productcert\/pdf\/ssa-389290.pdf\n- https:\/\/github.com\/advisories\/GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc"}],"vulnerableSoftware": [ {"software": { "id":"cpe:2.3:a:*:tar:\\<4.4.16:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}}]}, {"source": "NPM","name": "1070372","unscored": "true", "severity" : "high","cwes": [],"description": "### Impact\n\nArbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution\n\n`node-tar` aims to prevent extraction of absolute file paths by turning absolute paths into relative paths when the `preservePaths` flag is not set to `true`.
